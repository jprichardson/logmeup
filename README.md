## About
LogMeUp is software that you can use to monitor your log files. You can log data with any of the supported language plugins or write your own plugin to its REST interface. You can then see the data updated in real-time from your browser.

**_NOTE:_** At this time, since the application doesn't have any authentication mechanism, it should only be installed on your local network.
